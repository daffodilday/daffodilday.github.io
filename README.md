## Why?

**"Smoking is recognised as the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. It is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, renal disease and eye disease."**

Australia's Cancer Council has partnered with one of Australia's two biggest tobacco retailers, Coles, to raise money selling point of sale merchandise.

Coles Supermarkets and Coles Express petrol stations sell billions of cigarettes each year. Daffodil Day provides them with a massive PR opportunity but also creates a financial disincentive for Cancer Council to support changes that might harm their bottom line.

It's like selling 'cancer credits' to big tobacco retail.

Coles' competing supermarket, Aldi, does not sell tobacco.
